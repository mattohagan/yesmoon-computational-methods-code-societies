my right calf is a little numb and my eyebrow feels heavy and my forearms are kinda cold but i'm not sure why and i feel like i have to uncross my legs but i cannot uncross my legs my shoulders definitely hurt from spending too long today on a chair without a back. i guess i'm kind of hungry but the cottage cheese i just had was pretty filling so maybe i'm not so hungry after all there are so many keys
